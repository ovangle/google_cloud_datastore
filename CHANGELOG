version 0.4.1
=============

Breaking changes
- Removed horrible "reflection wrappers" misfeature. It just doesn't work.
Be more careful about releasing features in future!

features
- Added helper constructors to EntityResult

bugfixes
- If type was provided on @Property annotation, it was ignored when analyzing
  types during reflection
- getForeignKeyProperty returned `null` (rather than an empty EntityResult) when
  no foreign key was set
- setForeignKeyProperty did not set an EntityResult in the cache

version 0.4.0+2
===============

Bugfixes
- Type errors caused by wrapper classes shadowing mirrorfree classes

version 0.4.0+1
===============

Bugfixes
- When reconstructing entity from schema, `key.kind` was
  assumed to be a `String`.

version 0.4.0
=============

Breaking changes
- Key.kind is now a `KindDefinition` (previously a String)


Features
- Added a `datastore.list` method, which will stream all entities of a particular kind
  from the datastore
- All methods which accept a Kind can either accept
- Improved error handling
    - Exceptions in remote procedure calls now provide more informative error messages
    - Exceptions which were previously thrown synchronously are now thrown asynchronously
- Added instance caching of the entity values of foreign key properties, and utility
  methods `getForeignKeyProperty` and `setForeignKeyProperty` which will access the
  value from the cache without fetching from the datastore

Bugfixes
- Fixed problem where attempting to rollback a transaction hit an invalid remote endpoint
- Check for list indexation. Datastore lists cannot be indexed, but the library would have
  no problem creating an indexed list property



version 0.3.3+1
===============

Features
- Added a static `clearKindCache` method to `Datastore`.
   Should *not* be called by user code

Bugfixes
- filter ignored the subkind of an entity, resulting in incorrect 'NoSuchPropertyError's
- A subkind entity would be incorrectly transformed into a schema entity
- All errors in `transaction.commit` are thrown asynchronously
- delete failed to add keys to transaction

version 0.3.3
=============

Enhancements
- Subkind now discovered by reflection when using reflective version of library

version 0.3.2
=============

Enhancements
- Implemented kind inheritance. Multiple kinds can now be stored as the same datastore entity


version 0.3.1
=============

Enhancements
- insert, insertMany, delete, deleteMany are now idempotent transactions
- deprecated update, updateMany, upsert, upsertMany to encourage idempotence using
  `datastore.withTransaction`

Bugfixes
- Weakened kind checks when retrieving entities from datastore
- Improved error handling on property type checks

Other changes
- Removed deprecated annotations

version 0.3.0
=============

Breaking changes
- Entity constructor only takes single argument
Enhancements
- Query and filter improvements
  - Query arguments type checks relaxed so either a String or KindDefinition can specify a query
  - Filter argument type checks relaxed so either a String or PropertyDefinition can be used to specify a filter
  - Query can only filter a single property for inequality
  - Query must sort a property used in an inequality filter first.

version 0.2.3
=============

Bugfixes
- Query and lookup could add elements to an empty stream

Version 0.2.2
=============

Enhancements
- Deprecated @kind and @property annotations, in deference to dart conventions.
- Added example which demonstrates the use of the protobuf api.
